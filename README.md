# Heart_Failure_Prediction
Heart disease (HD) is one of the most common diseases and an early diagnosis of such a disease is a crucial task for many health care providers to prevent heart failure. 
In this project, a comparative analysis of different methods was performed for the classification of the Heart Disease dataset in order to correctly predict HD cases with minimal attributes. 
The goal of the project is to predict the mortality rate caused by heart failure based on 13 clinical features.
The 13 attributes consist of age, anaemia, creatinine phosphate, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelets, serum creatinine, serum sodium, and sex.
